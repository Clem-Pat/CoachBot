# Trainer Bot

The Trainer Bot is a project mixing software development and robotics. 
The CoachBot is a C++ application that controls and gets data from fitness robots. 
The robots use motors to apply a certain torque to the fitness bar so the user can lift it like a regular bar with plate weights.

The goal of the project is to estimate the athlete's One-Repetition maximum (OneRM). The One RM is the maximum load that someone can lift in only one repetition. Trying to know one's One RM requires lifting a really heavy load. In fact, it can be dangerous for one's muscles and joints, especially for injured people. This is why we need to estimate it. 
The software helps people to use a machine that can help them estimate their One RM. 

The second goal is to estimate the athlete's Endurance. This is the maximum number of repetitions an athlete can do at a specific load. This is  
It is separated into five main C++ classes. Trainer, TrainerApp, TrainerBotManager, TrainerDataManager and TrainerPredictor.
