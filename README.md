The Trainer Bot is a project mixing software development and robotics. 
The robot is ... {ToDo : Explaining what the robot is}

The goal is to estimate the One RM of an athlete. The One RM is the maximum load that someone can lift in only one repetition. Trying to know one's One RM requires to lift a really heavy load for the body. As a matter of fact it can be dangerous for one's muscles and joints, especially for injured people. This is why we need to estimate it. 

The software helps people to use a machine that can help them estimating their One RM. 
It is separated into 5 main C++ classes. Trainer, TrainerApp, TrainerBotManager, TrainerDataManager and TrainerPredictor.
